### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Know Grover Cleveland and Franklin D. Roosevelt from Presidential Inaugural Speeches
+ This project is conducted by Yuehan Kong

+ Project summary: Here is the little story I realized after doing a brief study about the texts of 58 U.S. presidents' inaugural speeches from George Washington to that of Donald Trump. I focused most on some presidents who won the presidential election more than one term and another two “special” presidents named Grover Cleveland and Franklin D. Roosevelt respectively.
